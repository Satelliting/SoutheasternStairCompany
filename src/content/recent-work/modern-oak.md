This project involved removing an outdated carpeted staircase and replacing it with a custom oak system. The addition of glass panels opens up the space and allows light to flow through the hallway.

## Key Features

- Solid White Oak treads and risers
- Tempered glass balustrade
- Minimalist stainless steel handrail mounts
- Custom stain match to existing hardwood floors
